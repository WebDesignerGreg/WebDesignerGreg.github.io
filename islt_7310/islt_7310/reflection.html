        <h2>How I look at Work</h2></reflectionheading>
        <reflectionparagraph><p>
            <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span> personally believe hard work pays off if you're willing to commit to it. It can be very hard to feel motivated to work but if you're able to find that motivation, you can go far. The sky's the limit. 
            I originally wanted to be a doctor and work in the medical field. However, it didn’t work out and that’s ok. As long as I keep working hard I can do whatever I want. Now I am taking classes that revolve around things I enjoy doing such as working with technology.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
                I was able to go to Washington D.C. and participate in a program that teaches you about leadership in national security. 
            I met other students from across the country who also were participating in the program. I went on a plane for the first time in my life and I left for the first time in my life. I’d say I did great, although it was very overwhelming at first. I was able to have a great time and learn a lot.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
                My very first job was at Wal-Mart and despite being just a simple retail position, I learned valuable life skills. Such as getting into a routine, dealing with people socially, and working hard. Not too much happened at Wal-Mart but I am glad I worked there because I was able to get a feel of what it was like to have a job and that benefitted me in the long run.
            ALDI was my second job after I left Wal-Mart for college. I started out full-time and then switched to part-time after school started and currently still work there to this day. Personally, I actually enjoy working there. 
            I occasionally have my bad days but that doesn’t ruin the job experience for me. I think ALDI is my way to constantly improve my work ethic and be the best employee I can be. My boss told me she likes how hard of a worker I am so I think I am doing a good job.
