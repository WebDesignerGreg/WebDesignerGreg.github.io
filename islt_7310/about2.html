                <p>
                    My name is <em>Gregory Romans</em> and I am a
                third-year student at Mizzou. My current
                major is educational studies with an emphasis
                on video game/simulation design. 
                <br/>My previous
                major before I switched was biology because I
                wanted to work in the medicLcal field, however
                due to low grades and enduring constant stress
                and anxiety from the classes. I decided to
                switch to something I can actually be good at,
                which is video games and technology. I think
                that since I am familiar with video games and
                technology I would succeed more in these
                courses. I have also been playing video games
                since I was old enough to hold a controller.
                Therefore, I figured why not make a career out
                of the thing I love to do. I am new to learning
                how everything but I am excited to challenge
                myself and learn new skills
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Education Overview</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, I am a third-year student at Mizzou.
                    In terms of current education I have a high school diploma and a associates degree that I acquired through Highschool.
                    My Junior and Senior year of highschool was spent at the Missouri State University of West Plains Community College.
                    I took general studies courses such as Math, Biology, History, and Writing/Litrerature.
                    I am also proud to say I made the dean's list three semesters in a row.
