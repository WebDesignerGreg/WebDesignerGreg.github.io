            My name is <em>Gregory Romans</em> and I am a
        third-year student at Mizzou. My current
        major is educational studies with an emphasis
        on video game/simulation design. 
        <br/>My previous
        major before I switched was biology because I
        wanted to work in the medicLcal field, however
        due to low grades and enduring constant stress
        and anxiety from the classes. I decided to
        switch to something I can actually be good at,
        which is video games and technology. I think
        that since I am familiar with video games and
        technology I would succeed more in these
        courses. I have also been playing video games
        since I was old enough to hold a controller.
        Therefore, I figured why not make a career out
        of the thing I love to do. I am new to learning
        how everything but I am excited to challenge
        myself and learn new skills
